## 8. Risk Management

### 8.1 Identified Risks
- [ ] **Performance risks**: Flight search performance may degrade under high load
- [ ] **Integration risks**: External payment systems integration may face unexpected issues
- [ ] **Data consistency risks**: Dual database approach in Product Service requires careful synchronization
- [ ] **Scalability risks**: Booking service may become a bottleneck during peak booking periods
- [ ] **Security risks**: Payment data handling requires strict security measures

### 8.2 Mitigation Strategies
- [ ] Implement comprehensive performance testing early in development
- [ ] Create mock payment integration services for development and testing
- [ ] Design robust data synchronization mechanisms with retry capabilities
- [ ] Implement horizontal scaling for booking service with proper state management
- [ ] Conduct security reviews and penetration testing before handling real payment data
