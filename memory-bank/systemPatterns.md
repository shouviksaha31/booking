# System Patterns

## Architectural Patterns
- **Layered Architecture**: The application follows a standard Spring Boot layered architecture with separation of concerns
- **MVC Pattern**: Spring Web MVC for handling HTTP requests and responses
- **Repository Pattern**: For data access abstraction via JOOQ
- **Dependency Injection**: Spring's IoC container for managing dependencies

## Component Interactions
- **Controller Layer**: Handles incoming HTTP requests, validates input, and delegates to service layer
- **Service Layer**: Contains business logic and orchestrates operations
- **Database Layer**: Manages data access through JOOQ and Flyway migrations
- **Integration Layer**: Connects with external systems like Kafka and Elasticsearch

## Architectural Justification
- **Layered Architecture**: Provides clear separation of concerns and modularity
- **Spring Boot**: Offers robust infrastructure, auto-configuration, and production-ready features
- **JOOQ**: Provides type-safe SQL queries with code generation from database schema
- **Flyway**: Ensures reliable and versioned database migrations
- **Kafka**: Enables asynchronous messaging and event-driven architecture
- **Elasticsearch**: Provides powerful search capabilities
